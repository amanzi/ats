Primary Variables
-----------------


An evaluator with no dependencies that serves as the primary variable to be
solved for by a PK.  Note that users almost never are required to write an
input spec for these -- they are controlled by the PK and therefore the input
spec for this evaluator is written by that PK.

.. _evaluator-primary-spec:
.. admonition:: evaluator-primary-spec

   * `"tag`" ``[string]`` **""** Time tag at which this primary variable is used.
