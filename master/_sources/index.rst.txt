Amanzi-ATS

Amanzi-ATS is a code for solving ecosystem-based, integrated, distributed hydrology.

Capabilities are largely based on solving various forms of Richards equation, coupled to a surface flow equation, along with the needed sources and sinks for ecosystem and climate models. This can (but need not) include thermal processes (especially ice for frozen soils), evapotranspiration, surface energy balances, snow, biogeochemistry, plant dynamics, deformation, transport, and much more.

ATS is a suite of physics processes built for Amanzi.  As such documentation is split between process documentation here and framework documentation in Amanzi.  Links across the related projects attempt to build a uniform interface for the user.


Join the Community
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

ATS is more than just a code, but a community of users with a lot of experience in both integrated hydrology, Arctic hydrology, reactive transport, and ATS code development.  Please join us on our `Google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ats-users>`_.  We try very hard to create a welcoming community that supports and enables our users to do their science.


Installation
%%%%%%%%%%%%

ATS is now built as a part of Amanzi directly. Please see the `ATS installation instructions <https://github.com/amanzi/amanzi/blob/master/INSTALL_ATS.md>`_ on Amanzi's site.
