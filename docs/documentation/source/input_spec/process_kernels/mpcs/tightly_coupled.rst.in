Tightly Coupled MPCs
====================

Coupling is an art, and often requires special off-diagonal work for
globally implicit coupling on a single domain.  For instance, phase
change results in tight coupling of flow and energy equations;
off-block-diagonal entries in the preconditioner are entered through a
special-purpose coupler.
