Globalization Delegates
=======================

Globalization is the art of convincing a solver to find the solution.
Remember -- physics typically cares very little about *how* you get to
a solution, only that you get there.  If you can guess or otherwise
find the solution physically, without doing fancy math, go for it!
These delegates are handy utility classes which are used by MPCs to
effeciently leverage physics understanding in the mathematical solvers
to nudge the solver in the direction of a reasonable solution, or to
keep a solver from going off into a part of space which is totally
unphysical.  These can often make the difference between converging
and not converging.

Much of the efficiency of ATS comes from these delegates, and more of
them are always welcome contributions.
