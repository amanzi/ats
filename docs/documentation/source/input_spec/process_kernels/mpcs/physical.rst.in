Special purpose MPCs
====================

Coupling is an art, and often requires special off-diagonal work for
globally implicit coupling, and fancy games can be played with domains
to couple across domain interfaces both implicitly and sequentially.
Physical MPCs derive from default MPCs to provide special
implementations of some methods.
