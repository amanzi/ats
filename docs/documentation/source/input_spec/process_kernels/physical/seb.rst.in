Surface Energy Balance PKs
------------------------------

Integrated hydrology is not much use without significant process
complexity in source terms coming from the ecohydrologic environment.
These include straightforward sources, like precipitation, but also
more complicated ones such as evaporation and transpiration.

These terms are almost always tied up in a surface energy balance --
evaporation and transpiration are driven by vapor pressure gradients
between the atmosphere and the surface (either snow, ponded water,
soil, or leaf).  Solving a surface energy balance often requires
providing a bunch of terms, including radiated energy, conducted
energy, latent and sensible heat models, etc.

ATS currently has several approaches to calculating these -- see
`ats-demos <https://github.com/amanzi/ats-demos>`_ examples on
ecohydrology for a more in-depth discussion.

Biogeochemistry
---------------

To accurately predict watershed ecohydrology, a carbon cycle model is
needed to predict transpiration.  By simulating a carbon cycle, we are
able to predict the rate of photosynthesis as a function of space and
time, and photosynthesis governs root water uptake.  Currently only
one big-leaf model is available, but ongoing work is wrapping a
generalized Common/Colorado Land Model based on that developed within
the ParFlow team, and another ongoing project is working on wrapping
kernels from E3SM's Land Model.

Deformation
-------------

The unstructured mesh framework we use provides the opportunity to
include deformation of the mesh.  This deformation can be done in two
ways -- either node coordinate changes are provided, or volumetric
changes are provided, and the code attempts to iterate toward a global
coordinate change that satisfies these volumetric changes.  The latter
can be somewhat fragile for large deformation, but it does allow
simple deformation such as small, somewhat uniform subsidence.  The
volumetric deformation PK below does this based on a volumetric change
given by loss of bulk ice.
