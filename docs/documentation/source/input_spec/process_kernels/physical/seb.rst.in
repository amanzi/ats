Surface Energy Balance PKs
------------------------------

Integrated hydrology is not much use without significant process
complexity in source terms coming from the ecohydrologic environment.
These include straightforward sources, like precipitation, but also
more complicated ones such as evaporation and transpiration.

These terms are almost always tied up in a surface energy balance --
evaporation and transpiration are driven by vapor pressure gradients
between the atmosphere and the surface (either snow, ponded water,
soil, or leaf).  Solving a surface energy balance often requires
providing a bunch of terms, including radiated energy, conducted
energy, latent and sensible heat models, etc.

ATS currently has several approaches to calculating these -- see
`ats-demos <https://github.com/amanzi/ats-demos>`_ examples on
ecohydrology for a more in-depth discussion.
