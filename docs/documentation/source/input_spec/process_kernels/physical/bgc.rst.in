Biogeochemistry
---------------

To accurately predict watershed ecohydrology, a carbon cycle model is
needed to predict transpiration.  By simulating a carbon cycle, we are
able to predict the rate of photosynthesis as a function of space and
time, and photosynthesis governs root water uptake.  Currently only
one big-leaf model is available, but ongoing work is wrapping a
generalized Common/Colorado Land Model based on that developed within
the ParFlow team, and another ongoing project is working on wrapping
kernels from E3SM's Land Model.
