Geochemical Transport
---------------------

Geochemical transport capabilities are implemented in a few different PKs.

Transport
^^^^^^^^^

{ transport_ats }


Chemistry
^^^^^^^^^

Reactive transport is done by coupling a :ref:`Transport` PK with
chemistry using some variation on a :ref:`Reactive Transport` MPC.
Currently, ATS only implements chemistry through `Alquimia
<https://doi.org/10.11578/dc.20210416.49>`_, which calls out to either
`PFloTran <https://pflotran.org>`_ or `Crunch
<https://crunch.lbl.gov>`_ for reaction support.

Salinity Transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Salinity transport is not itself a PK, but may be implemented as a
variation on Transport_ by supplying equations of state that are a
function of the concentration of salt.  Examples of this are provided
in the regression tests and demos.


Sediment Transport
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
