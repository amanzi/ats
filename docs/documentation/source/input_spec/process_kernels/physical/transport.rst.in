Transport PK
------------

The Transport PK describes the conservation of mass of components transported
with water as it flows. The transport PK is based on the advection-diffusion 
equation, applies to one or more components that are dissolved in the aqueous 
phase, and is currently used in both surface and subsurface compartments. 
The key difference between surface and subsurface transport is in capturing 
the volume of water. In the subsurface, the volume of water is set by the 
porosity and saturation of the porous medium, while in the surface it is set 
by the ponded depth.
