Deformation
-------------

The unstructured mesh framework we use provides the opportunity to
include deformation of the mesh.  This deformation can be done in two
ways -- either node coordinate changes are provided, or volumetric
changes are provided, and the code attempts to iterate toward a global
coordinate change that satisfies these volumetric changes.  The latter
can be somewhat fragile for large deformation, but it does allow
simple deformation such as small, somewhat uniform subsidence.  The
volumetric deformation PK below does this based on a volumetric change
given by loss of bulk ice.
