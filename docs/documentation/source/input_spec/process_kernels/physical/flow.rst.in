Flow PKs
--------

Flow PKs describe the conservation of mass of water as it flows both
above and below-ground.  Subsurface flow PKs are based on 3D Richards
equation, which describes variably saturated flow in porous media.
Minor variations to this include the incorporation of freeze-thaw
processes.  Surface flow PKs are based on a diffusion wave equation
and Manning's model for sheet flow.  Variations to this also include
the incorporation of freeze-thaw processes.  Finally we include in
flow a "snow distribution" algorithm which takes as input
precipitation and applies it based on the existing surface level
(elevation + water + snowpack), thereby "filling in" low-lying areas
preferentially.  This makes for more accurate snowpacks at fine
scales.
