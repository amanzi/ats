Flow PKs
--------

Flow PKs describe the conservation of mass of water as it flows both
above and below-ground.  Subsurface flow PKs are based on 3D Richards
equation, which describes variably saturated flow in porous media.
Variations on this include the incorporation of freeze-thaw processes.
Surface flow PKs are based on a diffusion wave equation and Manning's
model for sheet flow.  Variations on this also include the
incorporation of freeze-thaw processes.  Finally we include in flow a
"snow distribution" algorithm which takes as input precipitation and
applies it based on the existing surface level (elevation + water +
snowpack), thereby "filling in" low-lying areas preferentially.  This
makes for more accurate snowpacks at fine scales.
