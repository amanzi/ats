IO
###

ATS IO includes three output file types: visualization files,
observation files, and checkpoint files.  The latter is mostly an
internal format that supports checkpoint/restart capabilities to allow
runs to be continued and is used in regression testing.

The first two are both ways that the user interacts with simulation
results.  Visualization is *dense in space but sparse in time*.  It
saves every grid cell's values, but realistically can only be done at
a subset of timesteps.  Observations are *sparse in space but dense in
time*. They typically integrate or average a quantity across (a subset
of) cells, but can be saved much more frequently (even every
timestep).  Therefore, they are complementary, and care should be
taken to use the right one to adress a given goal.
