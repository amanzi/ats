Logfile Control
###############

The user has a lot of control over what text appears in the logfile,
or what is written to the screen during an ATS run.  Typically one
will forward this to a file, e.g.::

   ats --verbosity=LEVEL path_to_input.xml &> out.log

The verbosity LEVEL controls how much is written to the logfile (see
below for valid options).  This option sets the default verbosity of
all evaluators, PKs, operators, solvers, etc of the simulation. For
more fine-grained control, each component also accepts a `Verbose
Object`_ spec which overrides the global verbosity to control output
from that component.


Verbose Object
==============
{ VerboseObject }


Debugger
========
{ Debugger }


Residual Debugger
=================
{ ResidualDebugger }
