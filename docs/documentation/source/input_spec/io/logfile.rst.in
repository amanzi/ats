Logfile Control
###############

The user has a lot of control over what text appears in the logfile,
or what is written to the screen during an ATS run.  Typically one
will forward this to a file, e.g.::

   ats --verbosity=LEVEL path_to_input.xml &> out.log

The verbosity LEVEL controls how much is written to the logfile:

* `"none`" Literally nothing.  This is useful for large ensembles of runs, but is not recommended.
* `"low`" Very little -- effectively just a summary of each timestep with no PK-level granularity.
* `"medium`" All of the above plus each PK provides a summary for each timestep.
* `"high`" All of the above plus each iteration in a solve of each PK at each timestep.  This also turns on `debug cells <Debugger>`_.
* `"extreme`" All of the above plus each evaluator will provide a summary of whether it gets updated or not.  Recommended only for input file debugging.

This option sets the default verbosity of all evaluators, PKs, operators, solvers, etc of the simulation. For more fine-grained control, each component also accepts a `Verbose Object`_ spec which overrides the global verbosity to control output from that component.
