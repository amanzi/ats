Surface Energy Balance Evaluators
---------------------------------

Evaluators used to solve the fluxes to and from the atmosphere and
between layers of the surface.  Typically in ATS these calculate
evapotranspiration.

Area Fractions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Frequently, the surface of a grid cell is split across at least two
"subgrid components," for instance snow covered and bare ground.  This
"subgrid" model allows smooth transitions between fully snow-covered
and fully bare ground.

These area fractions often get included as area-weights in calculating
full-cell quantities.

Two-component model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{ area_fractions_twocomponent_evaluator }

Three-component model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{ area_fractions_threecomponent_evaluator }

Three-component model, with microtopography
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{ area_fractions_threecomponent_microtopography_evaluator }


Potential Evapotranspiration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Models of potential evapotranspiration approximate the difference in
vapor pressure between the atmosphere and the soil as a function of
available energy, allowing the calculation of the max flux of ET that
the atmosphere could accept.  This can then be limited based on water
availability, etc.

Downregulation and limiters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given a potential, the actual ET is often limited by available water
(or nutrients or other quantities).  These evaluators are used to
limit, downregulate, distribute, or otherwise move a potential to an
actual ET.

Transpiration Distribution

Rooting Depth Fraction

Plant Wilting Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{ plant_wilting_factor_evaluator }

Soil Resistance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
{ evaporation_downregulation_evaluator }


Radiation Balance Terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often a balance of incoming and outgoing short and longwave radiations
are required to determine the energy available to go into latent heat,
and therefore potential evapotranspiration.

Note that incoming shortwave radiation is typically a user-provided
meterological forcing dataset.

Surface Albedo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that albedo is also a multiple subgrid component model, like
surface balance.

Longwave Radiation

Full Surface Energy Balance Models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Finally, in addition to the potential-based models above, a few
full-physics model are available.  These are often based on older,
monolithic models.
