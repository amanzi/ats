Secondary Variables
-------------------

All other evaluators are secondary variable evaluators, and these are
grouped by physics concept or process type.

Secondary variables, by definition, define functions that evaluate one
or more variables as a function of one or more variables.  Therefore
all secondary evaluators provide at least one "Key," which is the
variable(s) computed, and at least one "Dependency."

If the evaluator computes one and only one key, that key is provided
by the name of the parameter list in the `"evalutors`" list of :ref:`State`.
If more than one Key is computed, then the second must either be
guessed by the code (for instance if the provided key is
"saturation_liquid", it is likely that the other key is
"saturation_gas") or provided by the user.  If more than one key is
computed, all of the keys computed can be specified exactly via the
input spec.  Keys are provided in one of two parameters:

* `"my variable key`" ``[string]`` Specifically name the variable used as "my variable"

* `"my variable key suffix`" ``[string]`` Name a suffix, and the
  variable is given by DOMAIN-SUFFIX, where the DOMAIN is given by the
  prefix in the evaluator list's name.  This is particularly useful
  for collections of enumerated PKs, e.g. columnar PKs, where the
  DOMAIN might be computed on the fly based on a column ID.

Dependencies use the same approach -- each dependency variable name
may include a default, and looks for a "key" and "key suffix" as
potential options.

As an example, a saturation evaluator may depend on pressure, and may
detail all of its names via something like:

.. code-block:: xml

    <ParameterList name="domain:1-saturation_liquid">
      <Parameter name="saturation gas key" type="string" value="domain:1-saturation_gas" />

      <Parameter name="pressure key suffix" type="string" value="pressure" />
      <!-- OR EQUIVALENTLY -->
      <Parameter name="pressure key" type="string" value="domain:1-pressure" />
    </ParameterList>
