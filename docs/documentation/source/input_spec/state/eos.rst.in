Equations of State
------------------

The density of water can be specified in many ways, depending upon
phase and problem of interest.  Options are available from the
simplest (constant value) to functions of just temperature,
temperature and pressure, and temperature/pressure/concentration
(e.g. salinity).

Note that density includes both molar and mass-based values.  Most
density evaluators can provide either, or do provide both, the
difference being simply a factor of the molecular mass of water.

Finally, nearly all (except the constant value) equations of state use
a common set of models which accept all of temperature, pressure, and
concentration.  Many of these models ignore one or the other, so it
should be preferred (but is not necessary) to choose the right model
for a given evaluator.  Choosing a model that uses fewer of
these than the evaluator provides is valid, but it is inefficient.
Choosing a model that uses more than the evaluator provides will
result in an error.

Constant Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Like any quantity, a density can simply be a constant value, at which
point it is not a secondary variable but an independent variable.
