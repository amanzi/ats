{ State }

State consists of two sublists, one for evaluators and the other for
atomic constants.  The latter is currently called `"initial
conditions`", which is a terrible name which must be fixed.

Evaluators are individual terms used to build up a PK or MPCs.  Each
term represents a variable in the equation, and can consist of primary
variables (those that are solved for by a PK solver), independent
variables (those that have no dependent variables but are provided by
the user as data), and secondary variables (those that are functions
of other variables).  Note that all three may be variable in space
and/or time.

Example:

.. code-block:: xml
                
  <ParameterList name="state">
    <ParameterList name="field evaluators">
      ...
    </ParameterList>
    <ParameterList name="initial conditions">
      ...
    </ParameterList>
  </ParameterList>
