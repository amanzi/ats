Region
======

Given a domain, a **region** is a subset of the domain, and may be the
entirety of the domain and may be empty (the null region).  Regions
are used to define conceptual areas, e.g. wells, or geologic media,
or surface regions of a given land use type.  Like domains, regions
conceptually exist without the mesh. Once a region is **resolved** on
the mesh, it is represented as a list of discrete entities of the mesh
(either nodes, edges, faces, or cells).
