IOEvent

`src/utils/IOEvent.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/amanzi/blob/master/src/utils/IOEvent.hh>`_

Base control parameters for determing when, in time, to do something.

The IOEvent is used by multiple objects that need to indicate simulation times
or cycles on which to do something.

.. _io-event-spec:
.. admonition:: io-event-spec

   * `"cycles start period stop`" ``[Array(int)]`` **optional** The first entry
     is the start cycle, the second is the cycle period, and the third is the
     stop cycle or -1, in which case there is no stop cycle. A visualization
     dump is written at such cycles that satisfy cycle = start + n*period, for
     n=0,1,2,... and cycle < stop if stop != -1.0.

   * `"cycles start period stop 0`" ``[Array(int)]`` **optional** If multiple
     cycles start period stop parameters are needed, then use these parameters.
     If one with 0 is found, then one with 1 is looked for, etc, until the Nth
     one is not found.

   * `"cycles`" ``[Array(int)]`` **optional** An array of discrete cycles that
     at which a visualization dump is written.

   * `"times start period stop`" ``[Array(double)]`` **optional** The first
     entry is the start time, the second is the time period, and the third is
     the stop time or -1, in which case there is no stop time. A visualization
     dump is written at such times that satisfy time = start + n*period, for
     n=0,1,2,... and time < stop if stop != -1.0.

   * `"times start period stop units`" ``[string]`` **s** Units corresponding
     to this spec.  One of `"s`", `"min`", `"h`", `"d`", `"yr`", or `"noleap`"

   * `"times start period stop 0`" ``[Array(double)]`` **optional** If multiple
     start period stop parameters are needed, then use this these parameters
     with N=0,1,2.  If one with 0 is found, then one with 1 is looked for, etc,
     until the Nth one is not found.

   * `"times start period stop 0 units`" ``[string]`` **s** Units corresponding
     to this spec.  One of `"s`", `"min`", `"h`", `"d`", `"yr`", or `"noleap`"
     See above for continued integer listings.

   * `"times`" ``[Array(double)]`` **optional** An array of discrete times that
     at which a visualization dump shall be written.

   * `"times units`" ``[string]`` **s** Units corresponding to this spec.  One
     of `"s`", `"d`", `"yr`", or `"yr 365`"
