Surface Energy Balance Evaluators
---------------------------------

Evaluators used to solve the fluxes to and from the atmosphere and
between layers of the surface.  Typically in ATS these calculate
evapotranspiration.

Area Fractions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Frequently, the surface of a grid cell is split across at least two
"subgrid components," for instance snow covered and bare ground.  This
"subgrid" model allows smooth transitions between fully snow-covered
and fully bare ground.

These area fractions often get included as area-weights in calculating
full-cell quantities.

Two-component model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`src/physics/ats/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/area_fractions_twocomponent_evaluator.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/ats/blob/master/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/area_fractions_twocomponent_evaluator.hh>`_

A subgrid model for determining the area fraction of snow vs not snow within a grid cell.

Uses a simple linear transition to vary between liquid and bare ground, and
another linear transition to vary between snow-covered and not-snow-covered.

Ordering of the area fractions calculated are: [bare ground/water, snow].

This evaluator simplifies the situation by assuming constant water density.
This make it so that ice and water see the same geometry per unit pressure,
which isn't quite true thanks to density differences.  However, we hypothesize
that these differences, on the surface (unlike in the subsurface) really don't
affect the solution.

Three-component model, with microtopography
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`src/physics/ats/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/area_fractions_threecomponent_microtopography_evaluator.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/ats/blob/master/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/area_fractions_threecomponent_microtopography_evaluator.hh>`_

A subgrid model for determining the area fraction of land, open water, and snow within a grid cell.

Uses the subgrid equation from Jan et al WRR 2018 for volumetric or effective
ponded depth to determine the area of water, then heuristically places snow on
top of that surface.

Potential Evapotranspiration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Models of potential evapotranspiration approximate the difference in
vapor pressure between the atmosphere and the soil as a function of
available energy, allowing the calculation of the max flux of ET that
the atmosphere could accept.  This can then be limited based on water
availability, etc.

Priestley-Taylor Potential Evapotranspiration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`src/physics/ats/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/pet_priestley_taylor_evaluator.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/ats/blob/master/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/pet_priestley_taylor_evaluator.hh>`_

Evaluates potential evapotranpiration (PET) using Priestley & Taylor formulation.

This implementation is based on models provided in the PRMS-IV, Version 4, see
pages 90-93, Equations 1-57 to 1-60

Requires the following dependencies:

Downregulation and limiters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Given a potential, the actual ET is often limited by available water
(or nutrients or other quantities).  These evaluators are used to
limit, downregulate, distribute, or otherwise move a potential to an
actual ET.

Transpiration Distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`src/physics/ats/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/transpiration_distribution_evaluator.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/ats/blob/master/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/transpiration_distribution_evaluator.hh>`_

Distributes and downregulates potential transpiration to the rooting zone.

The transpiration distribution evaluator looks to take a potential
evapotranspiration and distribute it across the vertical column based on water
availability and rooting depths.  It also potentially limits the transpiration
to avoid taking water where it is not available (thereby crashing the code).

This model is based off of versions from both CLM 4.5 and PRMS.  It requires:

1. A root distribution profile.
2. A plant wilting factor (e.g. how water stressed is the plant?)
3. A potential transpiration, typically calculated from data or a potential
   difference based on a latent heat calculation.

Note this also requires columnar meshes -- meaning that the subsurface mesh
must have `"build columns from set`" provided.

A normalized fraction of water is calculated through multiplying the water
factor by the root distribution factor, integrating across the column, and
dividing by the integral.  This gives a factor which sums to 1 and can be used
to distribute the potential ET throughout the soil column.

Then, this potential ET is down-regulated and multiplied by the plant wilting
factor.  If there is no water locally, it cannot be taken.  Note that almost
always, if there is no water, this did not contribute (much) to the integral
and so is already small.  But if the entire root zone is dried out, this might
have been a bunch of small numbers which then got normalized to 1, meaning they
are all now significant.

Finally, transpiration may be turned off for winter -- relative to time zero,
parameters `"leaf on doy`" and `"leaf off doy`" are used to control when ET
is zero.  By default these are set to 0 and 366 days, ensuring that
transpiration is never turned off and the potential ET must include this
factor.  This is the right choice for, e.g. ELM output, or eddy covariance flux
tower data (where leaf on and off are already included in the potential
calculation).  It is the wrong choice for, e.g. Priestly-Taylor or
Penmann-Montief models, which are happy to predict transpiration all winter
long.  Good choices for those models depend upon the local climate, but may be
something like Julian day 101 for leaf on and Julian day 254 for leaf off (PRMS
defaults for US temperate forests).

Rooting Depth Fraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`src/physics/ats/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/rooting_depth_fraction_evaluator.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/ats/blob/master/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/rooting_depth_fraction_evaluator.hh>`_

Provides a depth-based profile of root density.

Sets the (discrete) root fraction as a function of depth.  The rooting density
is given by:

.. math:
   \rho_root =  \frac{1}{2} ( \alpha \; exp(-\alpha z) + \beta \; exp(-\beta z) )

This function is such that the integral over depth = [0,inf) is 1.  Then,
computing this over the vertical corridor is done by integrating this function
between the depth of the face above and below for each grid cell, with the
bottom-most grid cell integrating to infinity.

Plant Wilting Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plant wilting factor provides a moisture availability-based limiter on transpiration.

Also known as Beta, or the water availability factor, or the plant wilting
factor, or the transpiration reduction function.

.. math::

   \beta =  \frac{p_{closed} - p}{p_{closed} - p_{open}}

where p is the capillary pressure or water potential, and closed
and open indicate the values at which stomates are fully open or fully
closed (the wilting point).

Note the challenges of using this model with arbitrary van Genuchten WRMs.  See

Radiation Balance Terms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Often a balance of incoming and outgoing short and longwave radiations
are required to determine the energy available to go into latent heat,
and therefore potential evapotranspiration.

Note that incoming shortwave radiation is typically a user-provided
meterological forcing dataset.

Radiation Balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`src/physics/ats/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/radiation_balance_evaluator.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/ats/blob/master/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/radiation_balance_evaluator.hh>`_


This evaluates a net radiation balance for ground and canopy.

Here the net radiation is positive for energy inputs to the layer.  Note that
ground is based on the two-channel (land + snow) while canopy is assumed to be
a simple, single layer.

This evaluator requires that the surface temperature, snow temperature, and
canopy temperature are known, or at least being solved for.

This is combination of CLM v4.5 Tech Note and Beer's law for attenuation of
radiation absorption.  In particular, long-wave is exactly as Figure 4.1c in CLM
4.5 Tech Note.  The main difference comes in how absorptivity (which is equal
to emissivity, epsilon in that document) is defined.  Here we use Beer's law
which is an exponential decay with LAI.

Unlike CLM 4.5, here we do not split shortwave into direct and diffuse light.

Computes:

1. "surface radiation balance" -- Net radiation seen by the bare soil/ponded
   water, this includes radiation transmitted to the surface through the
   canopy, longwave emitted by the canopy, and less the longwave emitted by the
   surface itself.  [W m^-2] of actual area -- this does NOT include the
   surface area fraction factor which would be required to compute a total
   energy flux in W.

2. "snow radiation balance" -- Net radiation seen by the snow.  See surface
   above -- all are the same except using snow properties. [W m^-2]

3. "canopy radiation balance" -- this is a compute computation of the net
   radiation experienced by the canopy.  It includes the portion of shortwave
   and longwave from the atmosphere that are absorbed via Beer's law, minus the
   outgoing longwave emitted from the canopy, plus upward longwave radiation
   emitted by the snow and surface.  It also does not include any secondary
   bounces (e.g. reflected atmosphere->canopy->cloud->back to canopy, or
   transmitted by the canopy, reflected by snow/surface.

   - `"albedo of canopy [-]`"

     
Note that this is a *superset* of the physics in the "canopy radiation
evaluator," and is therefore mutually exclusive with that model.




Canopy Radiation Balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`src/physics/ats/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/canopy_radiation_evaluator.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/ats/blob/master/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/canopy_radiation_evaluator.hh>`_


Computes and sums the downward radiation terms, determining the total radiation
sent down to the surface from the canopy and above.

Computes:

1. canopy-downward_shortwave_radiation -- transmitted shortwave.  Note that
   incoming shortwave is attenuated by Beer's law, and partially transmitted
   without attenuation when there are gaps (e.g. LAI < 1) in the canopy.

2. canopy-downward_longwave_radiation -- transmitted longwave (see above,
   noting that Beer's law coefficients should be used that absorb most if not
   all the longwave radiation), along with longwave emitted by the canopy
   computed using a canopy leaf temperature and a Bolzmann equation.

3. canopy-downward_net_radiation -- this is a partial computation of the net
   radiation experienced by the canopy.  It includes the portion of shortwave
   and longwave from the atmosphere that are absorbed via Beer's law, minus the
   outgoing longwave emitted from the canopy (see downward above).  It does NOT
   include upward longwave radiation emitted by the snow or surface.  It also
   does not include any secondary bounces (e.g. reflected
   atmosphere->canopy->cloud->back to canopy, or transmitted by the canopy,
   reflected by snow).

Here the net radiation is positive for energy added to the canopy, while the
other two are positive for energy sent to the layer below.

In the canopy-downward_net_radiation, we cannot include the upward terms YET,
because these are a function of snow and surface temperature, which in turn
depend upon the downward radiation computed here.  So we choose to break the
loop here, by computing downard terms first, then iterating to compute snow
temperature, then compute upward terms.  The alternative would be to have a
formal snow energy PK that computed snow temperature, at which point we would
solve all of these balances to convergence simultaneously.

Evaluates the albedo and emissivity as an interpolation on the surface
properties and cover.  This allows for two components -- snow and not snow
(water/ice/land).  Note this internally calculates albedo of snow based upon
snow density.

Components are indexed by: 0 = land/ice/water, 1 = snow.

Incident Shortwave Radiation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`src/physics/ats/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/incident_shortwave_radiation_evaluator.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/ats/blob/master/src/pks/surface_balance/constitutive_relations/land_cover/incident_shortwave_radiation_evaluator.hh>`_


Evaluates the radiation incident on a non-flat surface.

Aspect modified shortwave radiation is determined by a factor which is
multiplied by the 'incoming radiation incident on a flat surface' to determine
the 'incoming radiation incident on a sloping surface of a given aspect' as a
function of slope and aspect, Julian day of the year, and time of day.  The
latitude and Julian day of the year are used to modify this with both time of
day and seasonal changes of the planet.

Note that some careful checking and experimentation has found that, in
general, the daily average incoming radiation times the 12-noon aspect
modifier correlates reasonably well with the daily average of the
product of the hourly incoming radiation and the hourly aspect
modifier.  It is notably better than the daily average radiation times
the daily average aspect modifier.

This implementation is derived from `LandLab code
<https://github.com/landlab/landlab/blob/master/landlab/components/radiation/radiation.py>`_,
which is released under the MIT license.

Full Surface Energy Balance Models

Finally, in addition to the potential-based models above, a few
full-physics model are available.  These are often based on older,
monolithic models.

Bare Soil Surface Energy Balance

Calculates source terms for surface fluxes to and from the atmosphere and a ground surface.

The ground is assumed to consist of two potential area-fraction components --
snow and no-snow.  In the case of snow on the ground, this solves for a snow
temperature, given a skin temperature, that satisfies a energy balance
equation.  In the case of no-snow, this calculates a conductive heat flux to
the ground from the atmosphere.

Calculates source terms for surface fluxes to and from the atmosphere and a ground surface.

Calculates source terms for surface fluxes to and from the atmosphere and a
ground surface characterized by three components -- snow, water-covered ground,
and vegetated/bare soil.

The surface energy balance on these area weighted patches are individually
calculated then averaged to form the total quantities.  All down- and
up-scaling of relevant quantities are done through the area weighting, which is
calculated by a minimum threshold in snow and a depression depth/geometry-based
approach for water.  All snow is assumed to first cover water (likely ice),
then cover land, as both water and snow prefer low-lying depressions due to
gravity- and wind-driven redistributions, respectively.
