Primary Variables
-----------------
`src/state/evaluators/EvaluatorPrimary.hh <https://github.com/amanzi/amanzi/blob/master/src/state/evaluators/EvaluatorPrimary.hh>`_


An evaluator with no dependencies that serves as the primary variable to be
solved for by a PK.  Note that users almost never are required to write an
input spec for these -- they are controlled by the PK and therefore the input
spec for this evaluator is written by that PK.

`"evaluator type`" = `"primary variable`"

.. _evaluator-primary-variable-spec:
.. admonition:: evaluator-primary-variable-spec

   * `"tag`" ``[string]`` **optional** Typically this is not set by the user,
     but implied by either the requester or by a fully qualified variable name
     (e.g. pressure@NEXT enforces that, on construction, `"tag`" = `"NEXT`".
