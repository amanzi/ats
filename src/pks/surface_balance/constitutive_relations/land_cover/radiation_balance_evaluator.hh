//! Evaluates a net radiation balance for ground and canopy.
/*!

Here the net radiation is positive for energy inputs to the layer.  Note that
ground is based on the two-channel (land + snow) while canopy is assumed to be
a simple, single layer.

Requires the use of LandCover types, for albedo and Beer's law coefficients.

This is combination of CLM v4.5 Tech Note and Beer's law for attenuation of
radiation absorption.  In particular, long-wave is exactly as Figure 4.1c in CLM
4.5 Tech Note.  The main difference comes in how absorptivity (which is equal
to emissivity, epsilon in that document) is defined.  Here we use Beer's law
which is an exponential decay with LAI.

Unlike CLM 4.5, here we do not split shortwave into direct and diffuse light.

Computes:

1. "surface radiation balance" -- Net radiation seen by the bare soil/ponded
   water, this includes radiation transmitted to the surface through the
   canopy, longwave emitted by the canopy, and less the longwave emitted by the
   surface itself.  [W m^-2] of actual area -- this does NOT include the
   surface area fraction factor which would be required to compute a total
   energy flux in W.
   
2. "snow radiation balance" -- Net radiation seen by the snow.  See surface
   above -- all are the same except using snow properties. [W m^-2]
   
3. "canopy radiation balance" -- this is a compute computation of the net
   radiation experienced by the canopy.  It includes the portion of shortwave
   and longwave from the atmosphere that are absorbed via Beer's law, minus the
   outgoing longwave emitted from the canopy, plus upward longwave radiation
   emitted by the snow and surface.  It also does not include any secondary
   bounces (e.g. reflected atmosphere->canopy->cloud->back to canopy, or
   transmitted by the canopy, reflected by snow/surface.

Requires the use of LandCover types, for canopy albedo and Beer's law
coefficients.
