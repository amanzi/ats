//! Evaluates the canopy radiation balance, providing canopy net and radiation to the snow/surface.
/*!

Computes and sums the downward radiation terms, determining the total radiation
sent down to the surface from the canopy and above.

Requires the use of LandCover types, for albedo and emissivity of the canopy
itself, along with Beer's law coefficients.

Computes:

1. canopy-downward_shortwave_radiation -- transmitted shortwave.  Note that
   incoming shortwave is attenuated by Beer's law, and partially transmitted
   without attenuation when there are gaps (e.g. LAI < 1) in the canopy.
   
2. canopy-downward_longwave_radiation -- transmitted longwave (see above,
   noting that Beer's law coefficients should be used that absorb most if not
   all the longwave radiation), along with longwave emitted by the canopy
   computed using a canopy leaf temperature and a Bolzmann equation.
   
3. canopy-downward_net_radiation -- this is a partial computation of the net
   radiation experienced by the canopy.  It includes the portion of shortwave
   and longwave from the atmosphere that are absorbed via Beer's law, minus the
   outgoing longwave emitted from the canopy (see downward above).  It does NOT
   include upward longwave radiation emitted by the snow or surface.  It also
   does not include any secondary bounces (e.g. reflected
   atmosphere->canopy->cloud->back to canopy, or transmitted by the canopy,
   reflected by snow).

Here the net radiation is positive for energy added to the canopy, while the
other two are positive for energy sent to the layer below.
   
In the canopy-downward_net_radiation, we cannot include the upward terms YET,
because these are a function of snow and surface temperature, which in turn
depend upon the downward radiation computed here.  So we choose to break the
loop here, by computing downard terms first, then iterating to compute snow
temperature, then compute upward terms.  The alternative would be to have a
formal snow energy PK that computed snow temperature, at which point we would
solve all of these balances to convergence simultaneously.
