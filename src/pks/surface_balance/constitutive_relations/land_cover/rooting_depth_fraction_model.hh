//! Provides a depth-based profile of root density.
/*!

Sets the root fraction as a function of depth,

.. math:
   F_root =  ( \alpha \; exp(-\alpha z) + \beta \; exp(-\beta z) ) / 2

This function is such that the integral over depth = [0,inf) is 1, but
an artificial cutoff is generated.

Note that all three parameters, a, b, and the cutoff, are provided in the
LandCover type.
